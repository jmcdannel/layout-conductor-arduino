   // Note: this provides DCC with two motor drivers, main and prog, which handle the motor shield(s)
   // Standard supported devices have pre-configured macros but custome hardware installations require 
   //  detailed pin mappings and may also require modified subclasses of the MotorDriver to implement specialist logic.

   // STANDARD_MOTOR_SHIELD, POLOLU_MOTOR_SHIELD, FIREBOX_MK1, FIREBOX_MK1S are pre defined in MotorShields.h

   // Optionally a Timer number (1..4) may be passed to DCC::begin to override the default Timer1 used for the
   // waveform generation.  e.g.  DCC::begin(STANDARD_MOTOR_SHIELD,2); to use timer 2
   
   DCC::begin(STANDARD_MOTOR_SHIELD);

   //  Start the WiFi interface.
